# 🏠 **Boston Housing Data Analysis** 🏙️

Welcome to the **Boston Housing Data Analysis** project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Boston Housing dataset, using statistical methods and data visualizations to explore key factors that influence housing prices in the Boston area.

---

## 📊 **Project Overview**

This project explores various aspects of the Boston housing market, analyzing factors such as:

- **Proximity to the Charles River** 🌊
- **Age of homes** 📅
- **Nitric oxide concentration (NOX)** 🧪
- **Distance to employment centers** 🚗
- **Proportion of non-retail business acres per town** ⚙️

Through the use of statistical tests and visualizations, we aim to answer key questions about these factors and their relationship to home prices.

## 🛠️ **Key Analysis and Methods**

### 1. **T-test for Charles River Proximity**  
We performed a T-test to determine if there is a significant difference in the median value of homes based on whether they are near the Charles River or not.

### 2. **ANOVA for Home Age (Pre-1940)**  
We analyzed the impact of the proportion of homes built before 1940 on the median home values using ANOVA.

### 3. **Pearson Correlation for Nitric Oxide (NOX) and Non-Retail Acres**  
We examined the relationship between nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres using Pearson's correlation.

### 4. **Regression Analysis for Employment Centers**  
We explored how the distance to employment centers affects the median value of homes using regression analysis.
